This little chrome extension automatically closes facebook.com, youtube.com and twitter.com after 5 minutes of opening any of these sites. Kinda helpful during exams.<br>

If you need instructions to install it:<br>
1. Download and extract the files.<br>
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` in Google Chrome.<br>
3. Check the `Developer mode` option on the top right corner.<br>
4. Click on `Load unpacked extension...` button.<br>
5. Select the directory you extracted.<br>
That's it.
